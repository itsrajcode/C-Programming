# What is an IDE?

**IDE** stands for **Integrated Development Environment**.  
It is an enhanced version of a text editor that helps you write more efficient and clean code.  

### Key Features:
- Differentiates different parts of your code using colors.
- Notifies you of missing semicolons or brackets by highlighting errors.

Popular IDEs include **DEVC++** and **Code Blocks**, but we will use **VS Code** for this tutorial series.

# What is a Compiler?

A **compiler** is used to execute programs written in high-level languages by converting them into a low-level language that the computer can understand.  

### Why MinGW?
We will use **MinGW** in this course because:
- It fulfills all our requirements.
- It is recommended by Microsoft.

### Example Code:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!");
    return 0;
}
```
### Explanation:
The line `printf("Hello, World!");` prints the text **Hello, World!** to the screen.

---

### Important Notes About `printf`:
1. Everything to be printed should be inside parentheses `()`.
2. Text to be printed must be enclosed in double quotes `""`.
3. Each `printf` statement ends with a semicolon `;`.

**Note:** Not following these rules will cause errors, and your code will not execute successfully.

# Components of a C Program

## 1. Header Files Inclusion (Line 1: `#include <stdio.h>`)
Header files in C (e.g., `.h` files) contain function declarations and macro definitions.  

### Key Points:
- **Preprocessor:** Processes lines starting with `#`.
- **Example:** `stdio.h` provides core input and output functions.

### Common Header Files:
- **stddef.h** – Defines useful types and macros.
- **stdint.h** – Defines exact-width integer types.
- **stdio.h** – Defines core input/output functions.
- **stdlib.h** – Provides numeric conversion, random numbers, and memory allocation.
- **string.h** – Offers string handling functions.
- **math.h** – Contains mathematical functions.

---

## 2. Main Method Declaration (Line 2: `int main()`)
The `main()` function:
- Is the entry point of a C program.
- Begins execution with the first line of `main()`.
- `int` before `main` specifies the return type.

---

## 3. Body of Main Method (Lines 3-6: `{}`)
The body contains all the statements to be executed, enclosed within curly brackets `{}`.

---

## 4. Statement (Line 4: `printf("Hello World");`)
A **statement** is an instruction to the compiler.  

### Example:
- `printf()` displays **"Hello World"** on the screen.  

### Rule:
- Statements must end with a semicolon `;`.

---

## 5. Return Statement (Line 5: `return 0;`)
The `return` statement provides the program's termination status:  

- **`return 0;`** indicates successful program termination.


# Applications of C

1. **Operating Systems**  
   - C is widely used in developing OSs like Unix, Linux, and Windows.

2. **Embedded Systems**  
   - Popular for creating microcontrollers, microprocessors, and other devices.

3. **System Software**  
   - Used for building device drivers, compilers, and assemblers.

4. **Networking**  
   - Applications include web servers, network protocols, and network drivers.

5. **Database Systems**  
   - Databases like Oracle, MySQL, and PostgreSQL are developed in C.

6. **Gaming**  
   - Ideal for game development due to its low-level hardware interaction capabilities.

7. **Artificial Intelligence**  
   - Used in neural networks, machine learning, and deep learning applications.

8. **Scientific Applications**  
   - C is used in simulation software and numerical analysis tools.

9. **Financial Applications**  
   - Applications include stock market analysis and trading systems.

10. **Graphics**  
   - C is used in rendering 3D graphics and game development.
